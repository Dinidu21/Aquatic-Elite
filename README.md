2. **Linting**:
   Run ESLint to check for code quality and TypeScript issues:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

3. **Formatting**:
   Format the codebase using Prettier:
   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates a `.next` folder with optimized assets. The build process includes TypeScript type checking and ESLint validation.

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the production build.
